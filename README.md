            <p>The bond between family members is the best. The Best thing about family, is singing songs together, talking together, sleeping together and also being a huge irritating band of bambling baboons with cousins. </p>

            <p>Here's a poem for family:</p>
            <p id= "poem">
                It's sometimes hard to put in words <br> just what I'd like to say. <br> But always know you are thought of <br> in a very special way.<br> Though the distance in between us, <br> keeps us miles apart, <br> There will always be a special place<br> for you within my heart! <br> I know for sure that<br> your tests will come negative, <br> but when I will come there, <br> you will always be my captive!!
            </p>
